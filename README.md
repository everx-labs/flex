FLEX is a fast decentralized exchange with a limit order book built on Everscale.

There are no intermediate layers between the trader and the blockchain here - everything works on native Everscale smart contracts communicating with each other. Namely, FLEX operates as a decentralized and distributed limit order book (DLOB), which takes a most common centralized exchange model: central limit order book (CLOB) and implements it on-chain via a distributed smart contract model.

FLEX allows to trade in a variety of tokens - from native EVERs to common and popular assets from other blockchains wrapped to Everscale-standard distributed tokens.
