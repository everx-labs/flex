**Note**: Currently you may get a certificate warning when installing Flex for Windows. This is normal, you can safely ignore it and install the app.

When installed, launch the DApp. Without authorization you will be able to observe the current state of the Flex exchange, orderbook and trade history in all listed pairs.
